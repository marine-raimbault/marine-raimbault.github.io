      <description>Why Start a Blog? I started my blog for three reasons: to show my work and document my progress, to build authority in my field, and because writing is way easier than creating videos or podcasts.

      <description>Welcome to my blog ! I&amp;rsquo;m Marine, passionate about exploring new things and documenting what I learn along the way.
What You&amp;rsquo;ll Find Here This blog is where I document my progress, share insights, and explore various topics that interest me. I believe in the power of showing my work: to me, knowledge is like a flame; the more you share it, the brighter it burns. ðŸ”¥</description>
